### **Can your model match real clinicians in rural Kenyan healthcare?**

#### **Challenge Overview**

This challenge simulates the critical, real-world medical decisions made by nurses in Kenyan rural health settings. Participants are provided with **400 authentic clinical vignettes**, each representing a scenario faced by healthcare workers with limited resources. The task is to **predict the clinician's response** to each vignette, effectively replicating the reasoning of trained professionals.
---

### **Dataset Details**

- **400 training** and **100 test samples** of clinical prompts.
- Prompts cover a wide range of domains: **maternal health, child care, critical care, etc.**
- Each prompt contains:

  - Patient presentation
  - Nurseâ€™s experience
  - Facility type

- Responses are real, written by expert clinicians.
- Dataset is small due to the high cost of collecting high-quality, expert-validated clinical data.

---

### **Goal**

Build an AI model that:

- Accurately **predicts clinician responses**.
- Matches the **nuance and reasoning** of real professionals.
- Can perform **well in low-resource settings**.

---

### **Evaluation Metric**

- **ROUGE Score** (measures text overlap with ground truth)
- Responses are normalized (lowercase, punctuation stripped, paragraph replaced with space).

---

### **Submission Format**

A CSV file with two columns:

```
Master_Index     Clinician
ID_XXXXXX        summary a 30 yr old...
```

---

### **Model & Deployment Constraints**

Your solution **must**:

- Be **quantized** for low memory usage.
- Run inference in **< 100ms** per vignette.
- Use **< 2 GB RAM** during inference.
- Use **â‰¤ 1 billion parameters**.
- Train within **24 hours on an NVIDIA T4 GPU**.
- Inference should work on an **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** or similar.

### **Disqualification Policy**

- **First offence**: 6-month ban from prizes + 2000 point deduction.
- **Second offence**: Permanent ban.

---

### **Leaderboard Mechanics**

- Public leaderboard: \~20â€“30% of test set.
- Private leaderboard: \~70â€“80%, revealed at end.
- Final scores and ranks are based on **private leaderboard**.
- Ties are broken by **earliest submission time**.
